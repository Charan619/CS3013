/*...get the toilet scrub brush,
Use some WooliteÂ® to get it out,
Pour some bleach when you're finished,
To eliminate odors.

You don't want your bathroom smelling,
Like piss and shit mixed together,
Because when it happens like that,
No one will want to come-

Over to your house,
And visit you,
Because the stench of poop,
Is so very-

Oh, I fell through the floor it stunk so bad; I fell through the floor.

Take a dump on the toilet,
Flush it when you are finished up,
I know that I just said that,
But it is still funny.
